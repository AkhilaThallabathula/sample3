            <h2>Reengineering the One-Way<br>
Information Process: A Case Study</h2>
            <div style="width: 890px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
            <div><p>In the following example we concentrate to analyze the factors behind the startling
change that took place when paper referrals were replaced with electronic referrals. Our
example is based on a study that took place in southern Finland focusing on crossfunctional processes within two healthcare units (Harno, Paavola, Carlson, & Viikinkoski,
2000). The process chosen for the study was simple: a health center general practitioner
referring a patient to a specialist at a regional hospital. While one unit began to utilize
information system when referring a patient to hospital, the other send referrals traditionally by ordinary mail. Parts of the study are reported in TQM and Human Factors
conference, Sweden (Lillrank, Paavola, Harno, & Holopainen, 1999).</p></div>
            <div><p>Both healthcare units, Peijas Hospital and Hyvinkää Hospital, consist of a hospital and
several health centers serving 150,000 people. Both healthcare units use similar internal
administrative processes, however, Peijas has an Intranet-type system connecting the
hospital with health centers while the information process between the parties in unit
Hyvinkää is done traditionally with paper documents. All internal medicine casesthat
were referred from health centers to the hospitals during the study are included.</p></div>
            <div><p>The process of making diagnosis goes in short according to following. First, in health
center a general practitioner begins to diagnose by taking the anamnesis, that is, a
preliminary case history of a medical or psychiatric patient. Patient explains the matter
in his or her own words and general practitioner uses interviewing technique to lead the
conversation in order to confirm or dispatch any presentiments of diagnosis that well
forth in mind. Based on the anamnesis and verbal communication general practitioner can
also decide to take laboratory tests in order to make the diagnosis more accurate. The
diagnosis can be then defined and the treatment process can begin.</p></div>
            <div><p>In roughly 95 percent of visits, the health center can handle the whole case. The remaining
five percent of cases require specialist’s resources for diagnosis, tests, treatment or all
of these. In such cases a referral is sent to a hospital. The behavior behind the sending
of a referral can be explained by several factors that may all have an effect to tip the scale
in favor of referring (Coulter, Noone & Goldacre, 1989).</p></div>
            <div><p>At the hospital, after examining an incoming referral, the specialist decides its level of
urgency, again in one out of the three categories. Within the given time period the patient
will be invited to hospital for consulting. The other option would be to send the referral
back to the general practitioner if the specialist decides the case does not warrant
specialist care. In practice, however, almost all referrals lead to a hospital visit. During
our study the specialists working with traditional paper documents estimated that one
out of five cases could have been treated at a health center with the help of some
consultation. However, they felt that inviting a patient in for consulting that takes</p></div>
            <div><p>normally 20 minutes was less troublesome and took less time than writing and mailing
instructions back to the general practitioner. Further, there were no economic incentives
to take this trouble, since the local governments paid hospitals by the number of patients
that were actually called in. In sum, the traditional process had neither procedures nor
incentives for optimal resource allocation.</p></div>
            <div><p>The Peijas hospital was built in the early 1990s. The health centers in the corresponding
healthcare unit Peijas were linked to the new hospital with a tailor-made Intranet-type
system. Initially it was assumed that the system would simply replace paper forms and
mail, and allow electronic filing. The effects were assumed to be speedier traffic of
information. There had been some plans to use the new information route also to integrate
secondary and primary care providers with an electronic referral system linked to an
electronic medical record. However, it was not known what the new process would look
like, or even less, if the procedures were going to work at all. The precautions were
justified since the effects of an integrated electronic referral system used for remote
consultations had not been studied.</p></div>

justified since the effects of an integrated electronic referral system used for remote
consultations had not been studied.</p></div>
            <div><p>The basic assumption when the integrated referral system was installed was that some
20 percent of referral cases could be treated at a health center with the help of remote
consultation. In practice, the amount was more than double. The ratio of referrals that
were returned to the health center grew to 50 percent of all referrals.</p></div>
            <div><p>The consequences from this were, first, that the number of patients who were asked to
actually visit a specialist was reduced to half thus reducing the burden on specialist
resources. According to the doctors involved, this happened in 75 percent of the cases
without any observable problems to fulfill of the appropriate treatment. Second, it was
discovered that the rate of remote consultations given by specialist varied depending
on referral urgency. Only 10 percent of the most urgent, priority I referrals lead to the use
of remote consultation, while the percentage was 30 for category II, and over 50 for the
category III referrals. Consequently, the major cycle time reduction came to the least
urgent cases. Third, the number of health center patients whose problems got the
attention of a specialist through remote consultation, roughly doubled that is from five
to ten patient visits out of hundred. This was due to the learning experience to utilize
cooperation with specialists in borderline cases. As a fourth effect it can be added the
hard to measure effects that frequent exchange of experiences had on learning on health
center side.</p></div>
            <div><p>Encouraged by the positive results achieved in internal medicine, the possibility of
expanding the system into other disciplines was discussed at Peijas hospital. Orthopedic
surgery was used as a comparative case, since its business process is in many ways
different. Internal medicine is, by and large, an intellectual process where specialists</p></div>
            
            <div><p>make conclusions from pieces of information of symptoms, medical histories and
laboratory tests. The information used is reasonably well structured and treatment is
often medication. Orthopedic specialist’s were not inclined to use e-mail consultations,
therefore a videoconferencing system was installed allowing the specialist’s to study xray images and the patient located at health center while interacting with the general
practitioner. In half of the cases videoconferencing was found to work satisfactorily,
however, it did not reduce the number of patients that were eventually sent to the
hospital. Thus, the relatively cheap e-mail system in internal medicine yielded a better
return on investment than the costly videoconferencing system in orthopedic surgery.</p></div>
            <h2>Managing Implicit Knowledge<br>
in Medicine: Challenge for<br>
Shared Knowledge</h2>
            <div style="width: 890px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
            <div><p>The limits of transferring knowledge as well as managing it only the basis of rational view
of man has proved to be inconsistent with the reality of medical experts in many ways
(Ferlie, Wood, & Fitzgerald, 1999; Patel, Arocha, & Kaufman, 1999). Medical professionals produce a great amount of knowledge, which a doctor has but is unable to articulate
or quantify easily. In frame of transferring technology managing knowledge refers more
explicit than implicit knowledge. To be more precise, most of medical experts transfer more
data than practical know-how to each other. The problems with sharing knowledge
among a specific districts of medicine rises from the fact that every each of doctor attach
a different meanings to data on the basis of their experiences of previous patients.
However, studies of social construction, learning and tacit knowledge gives us a
opportunity to approach the dilemma in promising way (Argyris, 1999; Berger &
Luckmann, 1966; Dixon, 1994; Koskinen, 2001; Polanyi, 1966; Polanyi & Prosch, 1975;
Sternberg & Horvarth, 1999).</p></div>
            <div><p>It is commonly accepted scholars that are two basic types of knowledge: explicit
knowledge that can be verbalized, such as knowledge of facts and concepts; and implicit
knowledge that cannot be made verbal, such as intuition and knowledge of procedures
(Patel et al., 1999). Even if the conventional synonym of implicit knowledge is tacit
knowledge, some of scholars use the concept of tacit meaning structures as well (cf.
Dixon, 1994). Tacit knowledge, by definition, refers to the inarticulate aspects or meaning
structures that cannot be taught explicitly and therefore are only learnt via direct
experience (Dixon, 1994; Patel et al., 1999). According to Polanyi and Prosch (1975)
textbooks of medicine are so much empty talk in the absence of personal, that tacit
knowledge of their subject matter. Therefore evaluating explicit knowledge (e.g., education) is pretty easy to do, but to evaluate its impact on tacit meaning structures of
orthopedic specialist’s is almost impossible.</p></div>
            <div><p>In management literature the meaning of intuition for leaders has not been studied very
much even if the importance of it for management was found already in 1930’s (Barnard,
1938). However, for example Patel et al. (1999) outlined a systematic approach to the study</p></div>
            <div><p>of medical expertise in order to understand the role that the acquisition of tacit knowledge
plays in competent and expert performance. According to them intensive care decisionmaking is characterized by a rapid, serial evaluation of options leafing to immediate
action. In this real-time decision-making, the reasoning is schema-driven in a forward
direction toward action with minimal interference or justification (ibid.). Practically this
means that doctors are tend to attach meaning to data more on the basis of their experience
than logical interpretation of facts. On the other hand we may say that the scientific
knowledge is in part socially constructed in different ways in a case of general
practitioner who is sending data compared with medical expertise who is interpreting it
(cf. Ferlie et al., 1999). Therefore managing knowledge should be always understood in
the terms of socially construction reality among a certain group of professionals.</p></div>
            <div><p>The importance of tacit knowledge in decision-making is proved to be more important
than explicit knowledge (Leprohon & Patel, 1995). In one study (ibid.) decision-making
accuracy was significantly higher in nurses with 10 years or more of experience than in
nurses with less experience, which is consistent with that we know about acquisition of
expertise in their domains.</p></div>
            <div><p>Managing the tacit knowledge may easily sound the answer for the problems of electronic
referring system. However, the tacit knowledge is also the issue of cooperation between
medical professionals. To some extent there will be always deliberate amount of ‘tacit
knowledge’ in healthcare organizations. Clinical professionals will retain a monopoly of
knowledge as far as professionals are forced to compete each other in terms of budget
and resources (cf. Ferlie et al., 1999).</p></div>
            <div><p>Barriers to open communication between different medical experts is understandable
when the goal of medicine is not integrated (cf. primary care vs. special care, science vs.
clinical care in university hospitals). Findings of Smith and Preston (1996) are pretty
common: senior management have problems regarding the interface between junior
doctors and other professional groups. An elite of professional workers secures easily
a high degree of autonomy for itself on the basis of possession of expertise (Ferlie et al.,
1999). However, tacit knowledge is said to be the primary basis for effective management,
and the basis for its deterioration (Argyris, 1999; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). Understanding the management of knowledge in the frame of rational man leads us easily situation
where the benefits of electronic referring system are limited (cf. Breite, Koskinen,
Pihlanto, & Vanharanta, 1999).</p></div>
            <h2>Knowledge Management Issues<br>
for Clinical Applications</h2>
            <div style="width: 890px;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
            <div><p>When utilizing applications of information technology in product-line orientated organization aspects such as the level of utilization becomes important. For example if only
every third salesman in a company types his or hers orders in a given database the
benefits of using an enterprise resource planning system barely exists at the shop floor.
In knowledge intensive organizations, on the other hand, the quality and usefulness of
the information content seems to play a leading role.</p></div>
            <div><p>Information collected and stored in product-line orientated organizations is normally
fixed-format information, for example, ordering codes that typically consist of numbers
and letter acronyms. When storing qualitative data in knowledge intensive organizations
the case becomes more complex. Storing personal notes is a trivial case, since one
understands all the matters that are relevant and connected with the stored information.</p></div>
              <div><p>On the other hand storing qualitative information for other people’s later interpretation
is a greater challenge. One must presume the form that the data will be later most useful
in; that is, one must understand the context the data will be later utilized in. In order to
fulfill the validity and relevance requirements of users the rationale behind the information must be somehow included in the stored data. Until we learn to do that we must
grapple with the quest of various oracles and gurus to explain us the true nature of
knowledge management.</p></div>
              <div><p>Slawson and Shaughnessy (1997) determine the usefulness of medical information
according to the following equation (Figure 2). Since in practice the fixed consulting
hours of doctors set limits to the dispersion or flexibility of the work amount, we can argue
that the more validate and relevant information the practitioners get within constant time
to access it the better.</p></div>
              <div><p>A cautious approach to introduce knowledge management issues in clinical applications
can be seen as a virtue. Sackett et al. (1997) argue that still 80 per cent of all treatments
are not based on scientific proof but on believes. Validity can be determined as the
probability of the information being true. For example the fact that an article is published
in an academic journal does not guarantee that the information is true. One such article
presented findings from a research that demonstrated how sodium fluoride effectively
prevents contracting osteoporosis. Later another more validate research findings
proved that there truly was causality between these two—only the effect sodium fluoride
had on the illness was just the opposite (Slawson & Shaughnessy, 1997).</p></div>
              <div><p>One barrier to the widespread use of knowledge management tools is the psychological
need of clinicians. Weinberg, Ullian, Richards, and Cooper (1981) found that 81 American
doctors in a distant geographical area consulted 23 experts, logging 11 calls to experts
each month. Six of these experts received over 90 percent of the calls, about 90 each a
month. Doctors consult experts, because it is a quick, cheap, and easy method. The other
doctors can also provide the psychological benefits that are not available from books,
journals, and computers. On the other hand, the doctors “answering” the questions may
sometimes not be much more knowledgeable than the doctors seeking answers.</p></div>
             <div><p>Also a review article by Smith in 1996 which looked at the information needs of general
practitioners made several similar conclusions, one of which was that doctors are looking
for guidance, psychological support, affirmation, commiseration, sympathy, judgement,
and feedback. Smith (1996) argues that this aspect of doctors’ information needs is</p></div>
